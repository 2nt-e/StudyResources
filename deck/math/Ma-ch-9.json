    "a": "An equation involving an **independent variable** ($x$ or $t$), a **dependent variable** ($y$), and the **derivatives** of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable (e.g., $\\frac{dy}{dx}, \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$).<br>Example: $ \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\cos x $."

  {
    "q": "Define the <b>Order</b> of a Differential Equation.",
    "a": "The **order** of a D.E. is the order of the **highest order derivative** present in the equation.<br>Example: $\\frac{d^3y}{dx^3} + y\\frac{dy}{dx} = x$ has an order of <b>3</b>."

    "a": "The **degree** of a D.E. is the **highest power** (exponent) of the **highest order derivative**, provided the equation is a **polynomial in all its derivatives**.<br>Example: $(\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2})^3 + 2\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$ has a degree of <b>3</b>."

    "q": "When is the <b>Degree of a D.E. Undefined</b>?",
    "a": "The degree is <b>undefined</b> if the D.E. cannot be expressed as a polynomial in its derivatives. This happens if the derivative terms are inside transcendental functions (e.g., $\\sin(\\frac{dy}{dx})$, $e^{\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}}$, $\\log(\\frac{dy}{dx})$)."
