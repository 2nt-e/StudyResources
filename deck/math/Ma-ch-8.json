    "a": "Application of integrals involves using <b>definite integrals</b> to calculate the **area** of regions bounded by curves, lines, and the coordinate axes."

  {
    "q": "Formula for <b>area under a curve $y=f(x)$</b> from $x=a$ to $x=b$?",
    "a": "If $f(x) \\ge 0$ in $[a,b]$ (above the x-axis):<br>$$ \\text{Area} = \\int_a^b f(x) dx $$"
  },
  {
    "q": "What if $f(x)$ takes <b>negative values</b> in $[a,b]$ (below the x-axis)?",
    "a": "To find the total area, you must integrate the **absolute value** of the function:<br>$$ \\text{Area} = \\int_a^b |f(x)| dx $$This requires splitting the integral at the zeros of $f(x)$ within the interval."

  {
    "q": "Formula for <b>area between two curves $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$</b> from $x=a$ to $x=b$?",
    "a": "If $f(x) \\ge g(x)$ in $[a,b]$ (where $f(x)$ is the top curve):<br>$$ \\text{Area} = \\int_a^b [f(x) - g(x)] dx $$"
  },
  {
    "q": "How to find area when <b>curves intersect</b> within the limits?",
    "a": "1. Find the <b>intersection points</b>.<br>2. **Split the integral** at the intersection points where the 'top' and 'bottom' curves change roles.<br>3. Sum the absolute value of the integrals for each interval."

  {
    "q": "Formula for <b>Area between curves $x=f(y)$ and $x=g(y)$</b> from $y=c$ to $y=d$?",
    "a": "If $f(y) \\ge g(y)$ in $[c,d]$ (where $f(y)$ is the right curve):<br>$$ \\text{Area} = \\int_c^d [f(y) - g(y)] dy $$"

  {
    "q": "When is it easier to use <b>horizontal slices</b> (integration w.r.t. $y$)?",
    "a": "Integration with respect to $y$ (using $x=f(y)$ formulas) is preferred when the **right and left boundary curves are consistent** across the region, or when the region is bounded by a curve and the $y$-axis."
  },
  {
    "q": "Key reminder for all area problems: <b>sketching helps</b>.",
    "a": "Always **sketch the region** first. This is crucial for: <br>1. Identifying the correct limits of integration ($a, b, c, d$).<br>2. Determining which function is the **Top/Right** and which is the **Bottom/Left** in each interval."
