  {
    "q": "Explain why <b>Phenols are Acidic</b>, but <b>Alcohols are Neutral</b>.",
    "a": "Phenols form the $\\mathbf{Phenoxide}$ ion upon losing $\\text{H}^+$, which is <b>stabilized by resonance</b> (delocalization of charge into the aromatic ring). Alkoxide ions formed by alcohols lack this stabilization."

  },
  {
    "q": "Explain why <b>$o$-Nitrophenol is steam volatile</b> but $p$-Nitrophenol is not.",
    "a": "$o$-Nitrophenol exhibits <b>intramolecular</b> hydrogen bonding, which lowers its boiling point and makes it steam volatile. $p$-Nitrophenol exhibits <b>intermolecular</b> hydrogen bonding, leading to association and a higher boiling point."
