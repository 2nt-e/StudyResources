    "q": "What are <b>coordination compounds</b>?",
    "a": "Coordination compounds are compounds consisting of a central metal atom/ion surrounded by a fixed number of <b>ligands</b>, held together by <b>coordinate bonds</b>. Example: $[Co(NH_3)_6]Cl_3$."
  },
  {
    "q": "Define <b>ligand</b>.",
    "a": "A ligand is an ion or molecule capable of <b>donating a pair of electrons</b> to the central metal atom/ion to form a coordinate bond. Ligands are Lewis bases. Example: $H_2O$, $NH_3$, $Cl^-$. "
  },
  {
    "q": "What are the key <b>types of ligands</b>?",
    "a": "1. <b>Monodentate</b> (one donor atom, e.g., $Cl^-$, $H_2O$).<br>2. <b>Bidentate</b> (two donor atoms, e.g., ethylenediamine, $en$).<br>3. <b>Polydentate</b> (more than two donor atoms, e.g., $EDTA^{4-}$).<br>4. <b>Ambidentate</b> (can donate through two different atoms, e.g., $NO_2^-$ or $SCN^-$)."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is a <b>chelating ligand</b> and the <b>chelate effect</b>?",
    "a": "A multidentate ligand that forms two or more coordinate bonds with the same metal ion, producing a <b>ring structure</b> (chelate ring). The <b>chelate effect</b> is the enhanced stability of these complexes due to an increase in entropy. Example: $[Co(en)_3]^{3+}$ is more stable than $[Co(NH_3)_6]^{3+}$."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the <b>coordination number (CN)</b>?",
    "a": "The number of <b>ligand donor atoms</b> directly bonded to the central metal ion. CN defines the complex geometry. Example: $[Fe(CN)_6]^{3-}$ has CN = 6 (octahedral)."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the difference between a <b>double salt</b> and a <b>coordination compound</b>?",
    "a": "<b>Double salts</b> (e.g., Mohr's salt, $FeSO_4\\cdot(NH_4)_2SO_4\\cdot 6H_2O$) are stable only in the solid state and <b>dissociate completely</b> into simple ions in solution, while <b>Coordination compounds</b> (e.g., $[Co(NH_3)_6]Cl_3$) maintain their complex ion identity in solution."
  },
  {
    "q": "Summarize <b>Werner’s theory</b> of coordination compounds.",
    "a": "Metal ions exhibit two types of valencies:<br>(i) <b>Primary Valency</b>: Ionisable, satisfied by anions, corresponds to the <b>Oxidation State</b>.<br>(ii) <b>Secondary Valency</b>: Non-ionisable, satisfied by ligands, corresponds to the <b>Coordination Number</b> and dictates the geometry."
  },
  {
    "q": "What are the two main types of <b>isomerism</b> in coordination compounds?",
    "a": "1. <b>Structural Isomerism</b> (different connections/bonding: ionisation, linkage, coordination, hydrate).<br>2. <b>Stereoisomerism</b> (same connections, different spatial arrangement: geometrical, optical)."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is <b>geometrical isomerism</b>?",
    "a": "A type of stereoisomerism that occurs due to different spatial arrangements of ligands around the central metal ion.<br>Examples: <b>cis-/trans-</b> in square planar/octahedral complexes (e.g., $[Pt(NH_3)_2Cl_2]$); <b>fac-/mer-</b> in octahedral complexes (e.g., $[Co(NH_3)_3Cl_3]$)."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is <b>optical isomerism</b>?",
    "a": "Optical isomerism occurs when complexes are <b>non-superimposable mirror images</b> (enantiomers) and are capable of rotating plane-polarised light. It is common in octahedral complexes containing two or three bidentate ligands (e.g., $[Co(en)_3]^{3+}$)."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is <b>Valence Bond Theory (VBT)</b>?",
    "a": "VBT explains bonding via the overlap of hybrid orbitals (e.g., $sp^3, dsp^2, d^2sp^3$) of the central metal ion with filled ligand orbitals to form coordinate bonds. It successfully predicts <b>geometry</b> and <b>magnetic behaviour</b>."
  },
  {
    "q": "What are the <b>limitations of VBT</b>?",
    "a": "1. Does not explain the <b>colour</b> of complexes.<br>2. Cannot explain the relative <b>strengths of ligands</b> (e.g., why $\\text{CN}^-$ is strong and $\\text{H}_2\text{O}$ is weak).<br>3. Cannot predict **spectral properties** or complex stability quantitatively."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is <b>Crystal Field Theory (CFT)</b>?",
    "a": "CFT explains bonding based on <b>purely electrostatic</b> (ionic) interaction between the central metal ion (positive charge) and ligands (dipoles/negative charge). It accounts for the <b>splitting of $d$-orbitals</b> and successfully explains colour, magnetism, and stability."
  },
  {
    "q": "Explain <b>crystal field splitting in an octahedral complex</b>.",
    "a": "In an octahedral field, the five degenerate $d$-orbitals split into two sets: <b>$e_g$</b> ($d_{z^2}$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$) and <b>$t_{2g}$</b> ($d_{xy}$, $d_{yz}$, $d_{xz}$). Ligands approach along the axes, raising the energy of $e_g$ and stabilizing $t_{2g}$. The energy difference is the <b>Crystal Field Splitting Energy ($\\Delta_0$)</b>."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the <b>spectrochemical series</b>?",
    "a": "It is an experimentally determined arrangement of ligands in order of <b>increasing field strength</b> (i.e., increasing $\\Delta_0$ value).<br>$$I^- < Br^- < Cl^- < F^- < OH^- < H_2O < NH_3 < en < CN^- < CO$$<br>Ligands on the right are <b>strong field</b>; those on the left are <b>weak field</b>."

    "q": "Difference between <b>high spin</b> and <b>low spin</b> complexes?",
    "a": "<table><thead><tr><th><b>High Spin Complex</b></th><th><b>Low Spin Complex</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Formed with <b>weak field ligands</b>.</td><td>Formed with <b>strong field ligands</b>.</td></tr><tr><td>Small $\\Delta_0$ (splitting energy).</td><td>Large $\\Delta_0$ (splitting energy).</td></tr><tr><td>Electrons follow Hund's rule (less pairing).</td><td>Electrons pair up before filling $e_g$ orbitals.</td></tr><tr><td>Usually $\\mathbf{paramagnetic}$ (more unpaired $e^-$).</td><td>Usually $\\mathbf{diamagnetic}$ (fewer unpaired $e^-$).</td></tr></tbody></table>"

  {
    "q": "What is the <b>magnetic moment formula</b> and its use?",
    "a": "The <b>Spin-only formula</b> is: $$ \\mu = \\sqrt{n(n+2)} \\ \\text{B.M.} $$<br>Where $n$ = <b>number of unpaired electrons</b>. It is used to experimentally determine the number of unpaired electrons and predict paramagnetism ($\\mu>0$) vs. diamagnetism ($\\mu=0$)."
  },
  {
    "q": "What are the <b>limitations of CFT</b>?",
    "a": "1. Assumes bonding is <b>purely ionic</b>.<br>2. Cannot explain why ligands like $\\text{CO}$ and $\\text{CN}^-$, which are neutral or anionic, are stronger field ligands than $\\text{H}_2\text{O}$.<br>3. Does not account for any <b>covalent character</b> or orbital overlap."

  {
    "q": "What are the <b>IUPAC Naming Rules</b> for Mononuclear Complexes?",
    "a": "1. Cation is named first, then anion.<br>2. Ligands are named first (alphabetically), then metal.<br>3.
